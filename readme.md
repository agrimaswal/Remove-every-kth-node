Given a singly linked list having n nodes, your task is to remove every kth node from the linked list. 

Example 1:
```
Input:
n = 8
linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 
k = 2
Output: 
1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7
Explanation: 
After removing every 2nd node of the linked list, the resultant linked list will be: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7.
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
n = 10
linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 
k = 3
Output: 
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10
Explanation: 
After removing every 3rd node of the linked list, the resultant linked list will be: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10.
```
